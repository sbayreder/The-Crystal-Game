## Crystal Collector
Crystal Collector is a game where the player starts with a number that they have to match by clicking the crystals. There are four crystals displayed as buttons on the page. Once a crystal is clicked a specific amount of points are added to the total score. The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game. They lose if their score goes above the random number. The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
